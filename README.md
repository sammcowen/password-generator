# PASSWORD-GENERATOR
### WHY
This is my very first javascript project to showcase my current Javascript implementation and logic of what I have learned so far.

### HOW I DID IT
 I created variables, prompts/confirms/alerts,  functions, if/else statements and for loops as well as eventlisteners atyhpes of charactersnd implemented them to create an app that
 allows users to select password length and types of characters, based on their input and choices, which then runs through a for loop to generate a random password that matches 
 userselected length and types of characters. Then the password will display into the textarea using a query selector and changing its valuee to the variable that holds the password.
 I also changed the color scheme and centered the webpage for a different look. 
 
### WHAT I LEARNED
 Don't give up. Break down the logic into simple small problems and tackle those first. Try out what you have, and then look for other methods or functions that can help you achieve 
 what you are trying to accomplish. Eventually you will get there. Also utilize all resources you have available.
